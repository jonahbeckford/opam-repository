  # Portable shell scripts for OCaml compiling
  #
  # ** The only portable shell scripts needed are that that compile the bytecode
  # ** interpreter for use in the dkml-component-staging-ocamlrun build:[] section.
  # ** Any other logic needed for compiling the full native-code compiler
  # ** can be done in OCaml bytecode. But since the portable shell scripts
  # ** do 90% of the work needed for the native-code compiler, no strong
  # ** reason (yet) to convert the native-code compiler installation into OCaml
  # ** bytecode.

  #   the r-c-ocaml-* OCaml compiler. Its structure mimics a
